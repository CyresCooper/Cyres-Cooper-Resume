          Full Stack Web Developer looking to leverage an extensive background in insurance and customer service . Earned a certificate in Full-Stack Development from the University of Miami to hone skills in Agile frameworks as well as product management lifecycles, while gaining experiences working with databases and getting to work within the software development life cycle . Gained the skills working with new programming languages, JavaScript, React, MonogoDB to name a few. Collaborated on projects with one being to overcome obstacles and deliver development work to a client. Enjoys cross-functional group efforts to meet goals and over-deliver on client expectations. While working with a team of four I was able to apply the skills learned working with APIâ€™s to develop a website that helped bring multiple movie reviews to one central site while also providing the trailer using a Youtube API while having a fully functional user interface. My educational and professional background working in the corporate world, combined with a passionate drive to solve problems and always continue to learn new skills, would make me a strong addition to any organization.
